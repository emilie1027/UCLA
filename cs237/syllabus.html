<h1>UCLA Computer Science 137A/237A: Prototyping Programming Languages</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

While many programmers think of programming languages as providing a
fixed set of features, it is very common to develop
extensions that provide new expressive power to existing languages.
For example, in the web space there are widely used frameworks like
Ruby on Rails for Ruby and JQuery for JavaScript, which provide a
huge boost in expressiveness and reliability for developers.  More
generally, (good) programming itself is often a form of language
design, involving the creation of new abstractions (for example, as a
library) that hide
complexities, provide strong guarantees, and make programs more
declarative.

<p>In this course students will
explore approaches to implementing new languages and language
extensions in lightweight ways &mdash; via an interpreter, a
source-to-source translator to an existing language, and
a library that extends an existing language.  Like CS131, we'll study these
approaches in the context of functional, object oriented, and logic
programming languages.  This course is a precursor and prerequisite to
CS137B/237B, which will be offered in Spring, where students will
design, implement and evaluate their own languages.  However,
CS137A/237A can be taken on its own and is independently useful.


<h2>Logistics</h2>

All of the course information and materials are available on the <a
href="https://ccle.ucla.edu/course/view/16W-COMSCIC137A-1?section=0">CS137A/237A
homepage</a>.  You must login using your BOL account in
order to gain full access to the materials.  

<p> The instructors are
<a href="http://www.tinlizzie.org/~awarth">Alex
Warth</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~todd">Todd
Millstein</a>,
and <a
href="http://www.vpri.org/html/people/founders.htm">Alan Kay</a>.
The TAs are Matt Brown and Alan Litteneker.

<h2>Getting Help</h2>

We will use Piazza as our discussion forum.  Sign up <a
href="https://piazza.com/ucla/winter2016/cs137a237a">here</a>.
If you have a general question that other students may be able to answer and/or could benefit from
knowing the answer to, you should ask it there.  
If you have a specific question about your work you should attend
office hours.  If that is not possible for some reason, you can send a
private note to the instructors through Piazza.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

This course assumes that you have taken CS131 or an equivalent
course.  In particular it assumes that you are comfortable with the
key concepts and language features of the functional, object-oriented,
and logic programming paradigms.  <i>This prerequisite will be strictly enforced.</i>

<h2>Text</h2>

All of our implementation work will be in the JavaScript programming
language.  Though JavaScript has its share of warts, it is convenient
because it allows the assignments to run in any web browser, which has
many advantages.  The optional textbook is <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">JavaScript:
The Good Parts</a>, which describes a relatively clean subset of the
language that we recommend sticking with for your projects.
   
<h2>Grading</h2>

There will be roughly six assignments through the quarter, weighted
equally.  They will involve implementing functional, object-oriented,
and logic programming languages in a variety of styles.

<p>Most assignments will have a list of optional "extra credit" extensions.
Students taking the graduate-level version of the course, CS237A, must complete
at least one "extra credit" project that is designated as eligible for
this purpose, or a project of their own choosing that has been
approved by the instructors.

<p>
There will be no exams.

<h2>Late Policy</h2>

You can turn in each homework up to 3 days late for partial credit.
If your score would normally be S, then being 1 day late will make your score S * 0.9,
being 2 days late will make your score S * 0.7, and being 3 days late will make your score S * 0.5.

<b>One second late is equivalent to 23
hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds late &mdash; both cost one late day.</b>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

Both SEAS and the university as a whole have strict policies on
academic integrity. In the context of our course, <i>we expect your work
to be your own</i>.  You are allowed to discuss assignments with other
students (and of course with the instructors and TAs) but must
<i>explicitly acknowledge the people with whom you interacted</i>.
Either way, <i>the code you turn in must be your own</i>.
