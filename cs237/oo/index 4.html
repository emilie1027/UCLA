      <abstract>
        In Part III of this class, we will &ldquo;prototype&rdquo; an object-oriented programming
        language using a technique known as <em>source-to-source translation</em>.
      </abstract>
      <section>
        <sectionHeader>
          <span>Introduction</span>
        </sectionHeader>
        <p>
          So far we&rsquo;ve seen two common ways to prototype a programming language: as a
          stand-alone interpreter, and as a library (or <i>embedded language</i>) in an existing
          host language. In this part of the class, we&rsquo;ll see a third common implementation
          style that involves translating a program that was written in the <em>source language</em>
          &mdash; i.e., the language you are implementing &mdash; to a program in some
          existing <em>target language</em> that has the desired behavior. This implementation
          style, known as <em>source-to-source translation</em>, can be viewed as a lightweight form
          of compilation: rather than translating all the way down to machine code, the language
          implementer gets to leverage the features in a high-level target language, which
          significantly simplifies the task.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach can be seen as a middle ground between the two other approaches we&rsquo;ve
          seen in class. Like with an interpreter, the source language has its own syntax,
          and requires a parser to convert this syntax into some form of abstract syntax trees.
          Like with an embedded language, it&rsquo;s often possible to represent features in the
          source language directly, using counterparts in the target language. For example, it
          might be possible to translate a function in the source language to a function in the
          target language that has the same behavior, which then allows function calls in the
          source language to be implemented simply as function calls in the target language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, some language features in the source language will not map directly to a
          semantically-equivalent construct in the target language. In that case, the translation
          has to construct some code in the target language that will behave as desired. Depending
          on the complexity of that code, it may be nicer to factor it out to a library so that
          the target code is as simple and readable as possible. Such a library is similar in spirit
          to the idea of an embedded language that we saw in the previous homework assignment,
          except that this library is meant only for use by the source-to-source translator rather
          than directly by the programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Part III of this class, you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;prototype&rdquo; an object-oriented
          programming language by translating it to JavaScript. We&rsquo;ll start out with a
          basic version of the language in Homework 4, and throw in some fancier features in
          Homework 5.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <sectionHeader>
          <span>Our OO Language</span>
        </sectionHeader>
        <p>
          We&rsquo;ll start out with a &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; object-oriented language with single
          inheritance. Our language is dynamically-typed, and has Java-like syntax.
        </p>
        <h3>Declaring Classes</h3>
        <p>
          To declare a new class in our language, you use the <code>class</code> keyword:
          <codeBlock>class C;</codeBlock>
          Well, this class is not very interesting &mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t even have instance
          variables! Here&rsquo;s how you would declare a <code>Point</code> class with two
          instance variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>:
	  <codeBlock>class Point with x, y;</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, every new class that you declare is a direct subclass of <code>Obj</code>,
          which is the root of the class hierarchy in our language. You can optionally specify a
          superclass in a class declaration using the <code>extends</code> keyword, e.g.,
          <codeBlock>class ThreeDeePoint extends Point with z;</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <h3>Declaring Methods</h3>
        <p>
          Our language supports <em>open classes</em>. This means that you can add new methods to a
          class without editing its declaration. In fact, the syntax of our language does not even
          allow programmers to write methods as part of a class declaration. Here&rsquo;s how you
          add a method called <code>init</code> with arguments <code>x</code> and
          <code>y</code> to our <code>Point</code> class:<codeBlock>def Point.init(x, y) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}</codeBlock>
          And here&rsquo;s how you override <code>Point</code>&rsquo;s <code>init</code>
          method shown above for instances of <code>ThreeDeePoint</code>:
          <codeBlock>def ThreeDeePoint.init(x, y, z) {
  super.init(x, y);
  this.z = z;
}
</codeBlock>
          Note that our language does not support static overloading. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that
          <code>ThreeDeePoint</code>&rsquo;s version of <code>init</code> takes 3 arguments
          whereas <code>Point</code>&rsquo;s <code>init</code> method only takes two arguments
          &mdash; the former still overrides the latter.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating Objects</h3>
        <p>
          To create a new instance of a class, you use the <code>new</code> keyword just like in
          JavaScript:
          <codeBlock>var p = new Point(1, 2);</codeBlock>
          As part of evaluating a <code>new</code> expression, our language invokes the
          <code>init</code> method on the new instance with the arguments supplied.
          Here&rsquo;s what happens when the expression
          <nobr><code>new C(</code><em>e<sub>1</sub></em><code>,</code> &hellip;<code>,</code>
          <em>e<sub>n</sub></em><code>)</code></nobr> is evaluated:
          <ul>
            <li>A new instance of <code>C</code> is created;</li>
            <li>The new instance&rsquo;s <code>init</code> method is called with the
              arguments provided, i.e.,
              <code>newInstance.init(</code><em>e<sub>1</sub></em><code>,</code>
              &hellip; <code>,</code><em>e<sub>n</sub></em><code>)</code>;</li>
            <li>The new instance becomes the value of the entire <code>new</code> expression.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Statements and Expressions</h3>
        <p>
          Our language supports the kinds of statements and expressions that you&rsquo;ll find in a
          typical OO language: the abilities to send a message to an object and access / update the
          value of an instance variable, etc. The <code>init</code> methods above illustrate
          assignment to instance variables, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next section includes a complete list of the statements and expressions in our
          language. We&rsquo;ll describe the concrete and abstract syntax of each construct, as
          well as its expected behavior.

          and how we&rsquo;ll represent it as abstract syntax in JavaScript:

                  statement&rdquo; (see below), or <code>null</code> otherwise.

            control structures like <code>if</code> statements and <code>while</code> loops. There
            is a very good reason for this, and we&rsquo;ll tell you all about it in Homework 5.
            Stay tuned!

        <p>
          Your job is to write a translator from our language to JavaScript. The translator will be
          a function called <code>trans</code> that takes the AST of a program and returns a string
          containing the JavaScript code generated from that AST:
          <codeBlock style="text-indent: 0;">function trans(ast) {
  <comment>// <text>do your thing!</text></comment>
}</codeBlock>
          Please do all your work in the file called <a href="trans.js">trans.js</a>.
          <script src="trans.js"></script>
          <script>

O.transAST = trans;

          </script>
        </p>
        <h3>Some Tips for Writing the Translator</h3>
        <p>
          It&rsquo;s up to you to design an appropriate translation strategy, i.e., a mapping from
          our language to JavaScript that will give the translated programs the desired behavior.
          Here are a few tips to help you get started.
          <br><br>
          <b>Re-read section about the &ldquo;class sugar&rdquo; in our JavaScript Primer.</b>
          The desugaring of the class syntax in JavaScript, which we
          <a href="../js/index.html#classes">explained in detail</a>, is almost exactly what
          we&rsquo;re asking you to implement in this assignment. So take another look, see how
          classes are represented, how super-sends work, etc. (You&rsquo;ll have to think a little
          bit more about how to represent instance variables, which work differently in our
          language.)
          <br><br>
          <b>Divide and conquer.</b>
          Similar to the evaluators you wrote in the first two homeworks, it is natural for your
          translation to be compositional. That is, the translation of an expression or statement
          should be defined in terms of the translations of its subparts (other expressions and
          statements). This leads to a nice recursive solution, and it also ensures that you allow
          the subparts themselves to be arbitrarily complex. For example, the arguments to a message
          sends can be arbitrary expressions, including other message sends.
        </p>
        <h3>Unit Tests</h3>
        <p>
          We have included some unit tests for your translator below. As in the previous
          assignments, you can add your own test cases by editing
          <a href="hw4-tests.js"><code>hw4-tests.js</code></a>.

        <h3>Part II: Look ma, no primitives!</h3>
        <p>
          In mainstream &ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo; languages like Java and C++, primitive values like <code>5</code> and
          <code>true</code> are not real objects. This is unfortunate because (among other things) it often forces
          programmers to write code in an unnatural way. Here are a couple of examples:
          <ul>
            <li>Isn't it annoying that you can write <code>getAge()</code> as a method of <code>Person</code>, but you
              can't write <code>factorial</code> as a method of <code>int</code>?</li>
            <li>Why is it that primitive types like <code>int</code> are not classes?!?! In Java,
              this means that you can't use them as type parameters of a generic class / interface. For example, you
              can't have a <code>Set&lt;int&gt;</code> &mdash; instead, you're stuck with
              <code>Set&lt;Integer&gt;</code>, i.e., a set of <i>boxed</i> <code>int</code>s. Is this really something
              the programmer should have to deal with?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          As an aspiring language designer, we hope this lack of uniformity gives you the heebie-jeebies, and we know
          you can do better! It shouldn't matter how an integer is represented at the language implementation level.
          Our job is to help programmers, and we shouldn't expose them to implementation details that make programming
          more complicated than it has to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Homework 5, we will make our language into a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; object-oriented language, i.e., a language in which
          <i>everything</i> is an object. As we'll see, this has some really nice benefits for the expressiveness of
          the language. OK, you're clearly excited about this&hellip; Alright then, we won't make you wait until
          Homework 5 to get a taste of the pure stuff :)
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first step toward supporting pure OO programming, modify your implementation of the API described above
          so that JavaScript's primitive numbers can be used as first-class objects in your language. For example,
          <code>OO.send(6, '*', 7)</code> should evaluate to <code>42</code>. Here are the changes you'll have to make:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>OO.initializeCT()</code> should declare the following classes and methods:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>Object</code>
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>initialize()</code>, <code>===</code>, and <code>!==</code> should work as described
                      previously.</li>
                    <li><code>isNumber()</code> returns <code>false</code></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>Number</code> (a subclass of <code>Object</code>)
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>isNumber()</code> returns <code>true</code></li>
                    <li><code>+ anotherNumber</code> returns the sum of the receiver and <code>anotherNumber</code>
                    <li><code>- anotherNumber</code> &hellip;
                    <li><code>* anotherNumber</code> &hellip;
                    <li><code>/ anotherNumber</code> &hellip;
                    <li><code>% anotherNumber</code> &hellip;
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              When <code>typeof recv === 'number'</code>,<br>
              <code>OO.send(recv, selector, arg<sub>1</sub>, arg<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;)</code> should look up the
              method with the name <code>selector</code> in the <code>Number</code> class.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <span>Homework 5: Completing the Prototype</span>
        </sectionHeader>
        <p>
          <due>
            <b>Due at 11:30pm on Wednesday, March 4.</b>
            Turn in just your <tt>trans.js</tt> file through the course page on CCLE.
          </due>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this homework, you will complete the prototype of our OO language. This will include doing a little more
          work on the library that you implemented for Homework 4, and writing a translator from our OO language to
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h3>Part I: Objectifying More Primitives</h3>
        <p>
          Modify <code>OO.initializeCT()</code> to:
          <ul>
            <li>Add <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&leq;</code>, <code>&geq;</code>, and <code>&gt;</code> methods to the
              <code>Number</code> class. These methods should have the same semantics as their corresponding operators
              in JavaScript.</li>
            <li>
              Declare the following classes:
              <ul>
                <li><code>Null</code> (a subclass of <code>Object</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Boolean</code> (a subclass of <code>Object</code>)</li>
                <li><code>True</code> (a subclass of <code>Boolean</code>)</li>
                <li><code>False</code> (a subclass of <code>Boolean</code>)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> The new classes listed above should not have any instance variables. They shouldn't have any
          methods either, though by the time you're done with this assignment, you will be able to declare methods for
          them using the source language, e.g., <codeBlock>def Boolean.isBoolean() { return true; }</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now modify <code>OO.send()</code> so that:
          <ul>
            <li><code>OO.send(null,</code>
              selector<code>, </code>e<sub>1</sub><code>, </code>e<sub>2</sub><code>, &hellip;)</code> looks up the
              appropriate method in the <code>Null</code> class.</li>
            <li>Similarly, when the receiver is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, method lookup should happen in
              the <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> class, respectively.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Unit Tests for Part I</h4>
        <script src="hw5-tests.js"></script>
        <p>
          You can add your own test cases by editing <a href="hw5-tests.js"><code>hw5-tests.js</code></a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Part II: The Translator</h3>
        <p>
          You will now write a translator from our OO language to JavaScript. Some of the features of our language
          (e.g., class declarations) can be translated to a single method call that uses the OO library that you wrote
          in Homework 4. Other features will have to be translated to JavaScript code that has the desired behavior
          &mdash; it will be your job to design an appropriate translation strategy for these features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Source programs will be provided as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) similar to the ones you saw in Homeworks 1
          and 2. Your translator will take an AST as an argument, and return a string containing the JavaScript code
          generated from that AST: <codeBlock>O.transAST = function(ast) {
  // TODO: translate the AST to JavaScript
};</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> It is important that you store your translation function in <code>O.transAST</code>. This will
          hook it up to our test harness (which will also be used for grading!) and let you use the playground below
          to experiment with your prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar to the evaluators you wrote in the first two homeworks, it is natural for your translation to be
          compositional. That is, the translation of an expression or statement should be defined in terms of the
          translations of its subparts (other expressions and statements). This leads to a nice recursive solution,
          and it also ensures that you allow the subparts to be themselves arbitrarily complex. For example, the
          arguments to message sends can be arbitrary expressions, including other message sends. Also like those
          earlier homeworks, your implementation will need to &ldquo;dispatch&rdquo; on the kind of AST node being considered.
          <i>We strongly encourage you to use the pattern matching library that you wrote in Homework 3 for this
          purpose.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of this section shows how the concrete syntax of each of the constructs in our language is
          represented as an AST node. We also explain the semantics of some of the constructs.
        </p>
        <h4>Programs</h4>
        <p>
          The top-level AST node will always represent an entire program. A program in our OO language consists of zero
          or more <i>source elements</i>, each of which may be a class declaration, a method declaration, or a
          statement. The AST node for a program includes the tag <code>'program'</code> followed by the AST nodes for
          the program's source elements: <codeBlock>new Program([<text>e<sub>1</sub></text>,<text> &hellip;</text>,<text>e<sub>2</sub></text>])</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Hint:</b> The first thing you should generate from a program node is the following statement,
          <codeBlock>OO.initializeCT();</codeBlock>
          that way every time a program is evaluated, it starts with a clean slate.
        </p>
        <h4>Class Declarations</h4>
        <p>
          We represent class declarations, e.g.,
          <codeBlock>class ThreeDeePoint extends Point with z;</codeBlock>
          as <code>ClassDecl</code> nodes that include the name of the class that is being declared,
          the name of its superclass, and a list of its instance variable names, e.g.,
          <codeBlock>new ClassDecl('ThreeDeePoint', 'Point', ['z'])</codeBlock>
          Note that the name of the superclass is included in the <code>ClassDecl</code> node even when it's not written explicitly
          in the concrete syntax, e.g.,
          <codeBlock>class Point with x, y;</codeBlock>
          is represented as
          <codeBlock>new ClassDecl('Point', 'Object', ['x', 'y'])</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <h4>Method Declarations</h4>
        <p>
          Method declarations, e.g.,
          <codeBlock>def C.m(a, b, c) { &hellip; }</codeBlock>
          are represented as <code>methodDecl</code> nodes that include the name of the class in which the method is
          being declared, the name of the method, a list containing the names of its arguments, and a list containing
          the ASTs of the statements in its body, e.g.,
          <codeBlock>new MethodDecl('C', 'm', ['a', 'b', 'c'], [...])</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the result of calling a method that doesn't return a value should be <code>null</code>. E.g., <codeBlock>def Object.m() { }
new Object().m();  // should evaluate to null</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <h4>Statements and Expressions</h4>
        <h4>Unit Tests for Part II</h4>
        <script src="hw5-tests-part2.js"></script>
        <p>
          You can add your own test cases by editing <a href="hw5-tests-part2.js"><code>hw5-tests-part2.js</code></a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Part III: Blocks</h3>
        <p>
          Borrowing from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, our language also includes <i>blocks</i>, which are essentially an object-oriented
          version of <i>lambdas</i> (a.k.a. first-class functions). Here are some examples:
          <ul>
            <li>a block with no arguments: <code>{1 + 2}</code></li>
            <li>a block with two arguments, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>: <code>{ x, y | x + y }</code></li>
            <li>a block with one argument whose body consists of multiple statements: <code>{ x | x.m(); x.n(); }</code></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, a block can have any number of declared arguments and its body can consist of any number of
          statements. When the last statement is an expression statement, the semicolon at the end is optional.
        </p>
        <p>
          <table class="syntax">
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th>Concrete Syntax</th>
              <th>JS AST</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>e ::=</td>
              <td>
                <multival>
                  <div>&hellip;</div>
                  <div><code>{ </code>x<sub>1</sub><code>,</code> &hellip;<code>,</code> x<sub>n</sub> <code>|</code> s<sub>1</sub> &hellip; s<sub>m</sub> <code> }</code></div>
                </multival>
              </td>
              <td>
                <div>&hellip;</div>
                <div><code>new Block([</code>x<sub>1</sub><code>,</code> &hellip;<code>,</code> x<sub>n</sub><code>], [</code>s<sub>1</sub><code>,</code> &hellip;<code>,</code> s<sub>m</sub><code>])</code></div>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>
        <p>
          You evaluate a block by sending it a <code>call</code> message, to which you can pass the appropriate
          arguments. Unlike in a method body, which requires an explicit <code>return</code> statement, a block
          implicitly returns the value of its last statement, if it's an expression statement, or <code>null</code>
          otherwise. Here are some examples:
          <ul>
            <li><code>{1 + 2}.call()</code> should evaluate to <code>3</code></li>
            <li><code>{ x, y | x * y }.call(6, 7)</code> should evaluate to <code>42</code></li>
            <li><code>{ x | x.m(); x.n(); }.call(someObj)</code> should result in calling <code>someObj</code>'s <code>m</code> method, then <code>someObj</code>'s
              <code>n</code> method, and evaluate to the result of the latter</li>
            <li><code>{ 1 + 2; var x = true; }.call()</code> should evaluate to <code>null</code></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like lambdas, blocks can reference variables from their surrounding scope. A block also acts as kind of
          lexical scope: any variable declarations that are made inside a block are not visible outside it.
          Conveniently, JavaScript's functions have both of these properties&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          So you can (and should!) avoid the need to implement the semantics of closures and lexical scopes from scratch
          by translating blocks to plain old JavaScript functions. As with the treatment of numbers and booleans, you
          will need to add a class for blocks (<code>Block</code>) that supports a <code>call</code> method.
        </p>
        <h4>Roll Your Own Control Structures</h4>
        <p>
          You've probably noticed that our language lacks control structures, e.g., it doesn't have <code>if</code> or
          <code>while</code> statements. It turns out we don't need any built-in control structures because it's
          straightforward for programmers to define their own, as ordinary methods. This power comes from a combination
          of <i>purity</i> (the fact that everything in our language is an object) and support for <i>open classes</i>
          (the fact that a programmer can add new methods to any class in the system).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, an if-then-else &ldquo;statement&rdquo; can be defined as a method <code>thenElse</code> on
          <code>Boolean</code>s that takes two blocks as arguments, one for each branch of the conditional. With
          appropriate implementations for the classes <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>, it is now possible to
          write conditionals like the following:<codeBlock>(x >= 0).thenElse(
  { x = 2*x },
  { x = x * -1 })</codeBlock>
          With the syntactic sugar that we saw in class you could write the following expression, which is equivalent
          to the one shown above:<codeBlock>x >= 0 then {
  x = 2*x
} else {
  x = x * -1
}</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <h4>Semantics of <code>return</code> Inside a Block</h4>
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, a block implicitly returns the value of its last expression statement. Sometimes it is
          more natural for a block to directly return from its enclosing method &mdash; this is especially the case when
          blocks are used to implement control structures. In our language, the <code>return</code> statement inside a
          block acts as such a <i>non-local return</i>. For example, here is an implementation of the absolute value
          method for <code>Number</code>s:<codeBlock>def Number.abs() {
  (this >= 0).thenElse(
    { return this; },
    { return this * -1; })
}</codeBlock>
          When a <code>return</code> statement is executed in the above code, it returns the associated value from the
          <code>abs</code> method itself, and returns control to the caller of <code>abs</code>, rather than just
          returning from the block. While it may seem like there are two different kinds of <code>return</code>
          in our language, this isn't really the case. A <code>return</code> inside a block means exactly the same thing
          as a <code>return</code> inside a method: return this value <i>from (this particular activation of) the
          enclosing method</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          One interesting issue is how to treat non-local <code>return</code>s in cases where the block is passed around
          before it is called. In our language, it's a run-time error to try to execute a <code>return</code> from a
          block whose enclosing method has already returned. Otherwise, it is OK for a block to execute a
          <code>return</code>, regardless of where on the call stack the enclosing method's activation record is. For
          instance, in the absolute value example above, a <code>return</code> causes the activation records for
          <code>Block</code>'s <code>call</code> method and <code>Boolean</code>'s <code>thenElse</code> method to
          be popped off the stack, and the return value is then associated with the original call to
          <code>Number</code>'s <code>abs</code> method. Here's another example:<codeBlock>def Object.m() {
  var b = { return 5; };
  return this.n(b) * 2;
}

def Object.n(aBlock) {
  aBlock.call();
  return 42;
}

new Object().m();  // evaluates to 5</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <p>
          To implement non-local <code>return</code> properly, the stack must be &ldquo;walked,&rdquo; popping off stack frames
          until the right activation record is found.  <b>Hint:</b> <i>Exceptions</i> already walk the stack, so it is
          natural to use them to implement non-local returns. The main difficulty is to ensure that a
          <code>return</code> is always associated with the correct method invocation.

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Re-implement this language as an interpreter similar to the one that you wrote for the functional
              language in Homeworks 1 and 2, and write a brief (1-2 page) report comparing the two prototyping styles.
              (It's OK to use your <code>OO</code> library in your interpreter.)</li>
            <li>Modify your implementation so that classes are first-class objects. After this change, a programmer
              should be able to declare new classes and methods dynamically by calling methods on <code>Class</code>
              objects. (Food for thought: what is the superclass of <code>Class</code>?)</li>
            <li>Are there other aspects of this language that could be made into objects? Consider variables, for
              example. If variables were objects, it would make sense for assignment to be a method (even though it
              may not look that way in the syntax). What kinds of interesting things might programmers be able to do
              if they were able to override the assignment operator? Another example is activation records: if they
              were objects, what would it mean to look up the value of a local variable? Lots of opportunities for
              extra-credit projects here!</li>
